Mercury is not only a computer programme.
It is a reflection of my idea how a computer translator must work.
Mercury is the first working programme which has all elements
necessary for automatic translation. 
This is its main value for the open-source community.
Later every elements of the programme can be improved by me or somebody else.
The text which you are reading now was written as a sample to show you how
the programme works.
It contains only the words which are included in the dictionary and correct
grammar structures. 
You will have more problems when you work with authentic texts.
Texts with mistakes or texts with words not included in the dictionary 
or literature texts can produce most problems.
However IT works. 
If you want to improve my programme, then write me.
My address is prawda@newmail.ru.
